# Graphical Modeling for Single-Cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> Imaging
Code accompanying S. Rolotti, T. Rutten, P. Wei "Graphical Modeling for Single-Cell <sup>2+</sup> Imaging."

`simulated_model_lib.py` contains code to generate random binary graphs used for graphical modeling of neurons. These graphs are used as the structure of the neuron. 

`model_lib.py` implements Expectation-maximization for neuron graphical models.
